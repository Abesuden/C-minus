As students of [Dr. Eggen's](unf.edu/~ree) compilers class, at the [University of North Florida](unf.edu), we decided to help create documentation for [Dr. Eggen's](unf.edu/~ree) C- language for all future students. The main motivation came from the fact that Google does not have every answer and when we tried to search for knowledge on the C- language, we could not find anything of use. Hopefully this helps all future students with understanding the C- language and have it help to build the compiler.
