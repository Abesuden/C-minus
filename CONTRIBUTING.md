 # For Current Contributors
 
 This repo has been set up with automatic bug reporting in the "Projects" tab at the top of the page. You should not need to change anything through the Projects KanBan, rather just use it to visually see what duties have been assigned. Otherwise, all contributors will be working in the "Issues" tab. Open and close any and all bugs inside the Issues tab and we will all work on fixing the issues together. Lets get to it!
